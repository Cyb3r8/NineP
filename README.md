- __Mystery Eggs__
Who doesn't like a good mystery?
All of the Mystery Eggs are always Shiny, Perfect IVs, and have the Hidden Ability.  What Egg will you hatch?
Command:  `me` or `mysteryegg`.

- __Egg Trades__
Thanks to Koi, I have implemented Egg Trades in this as well.
To request an egg, you will type `egg <species>` instead of `trade`.
Example:  
```
.Egg Charmander
Shiny: Yes
```

- __Server Blacklisting & Management__
Do you share your bot in several servers?  Is your bot a public bot where you allow anyone to add your bot?
Our advanced Server Management features allow you to easily blacklist any server.
Command `bls <serverid>` and `ubls <serverid>` to unblacklist them.
When you blacklist a server, this bot will automatically leave the server.  Adios!

- __Default Held Items__
Choose a popular default held item if the user doesn't provide one.  Choose from popular items like Ability Patch, Rare Candy, Fresh-Start Mochi, and more!

- __Events & BattleReady Folder__
If you would like to provide your amazing members with Home Tracked Battle-Ready Legendaries and Event Pokemon, just add the files to a folder on your local machine, and provide the path in the settings under **Trade > EventsFolder/BattleReadyPKMFolder**
You can download Home Tracked and Battle Ready Pokemon from my website that are ready to go!  (all .pk9 files)  Also, Thanks to all my discord users that contributed to these!  (Maddison, Marnie, Fly, Reedy, Newfie, Joseph11024)

Events: https://genpkm.com/tradebot/events.zip

BattleReady:  https://genpkm.com/tradebot/battleready.zip

For your users to request, they will use the following commands:

`le` will list all the events.  This is filterable, too.  So you can do `le 2` for page 2 of the Events List, or, you can do `le <species>` for all the specific species events. Example:  `le mewtwo 2` will give me page 2 of the mewtwo events.
`brl` will list all of the Battle Ready Pokemon in your folder for users to choose from.  The same filter applies to this command as above.

The user will be DM'd a list and given the correct command with your bots prefix to allow them to request it.
